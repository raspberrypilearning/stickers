## Challenge: Create your own gradient sticker

Now make your own gradient sticker. Try linear and radial gradients using multiple HTML colours. 

You'll need to:

+ Add a `<div>` with your sticker text to `index.html` and give it the `sticker` class and a new `id`.
+ Add style for the `id` you chose in `style.css`. You could copy one of the sticker styles you have already made and edit that. 

Thereâ€™s a list of all the colour names you can use: [jumpto.cc/web-colours](http://jumpto.cc/web-colours), which includes colour names like `tomato`, `firebrick` and `peachpuff`.

If you want to change the text colour you can use `color:`.

Here's an example of what you can do with multiple colours in a linear gradient:
